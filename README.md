Redo mana system with new network handling

Add following attributes(not through capabilities): Attack Damage, Ability Power, Armor, Magic Resist, Attack Speed, Ability Haste, Crit Chance, Movement Speed, Lethality, Shred, Life Steal, Attack Range, Tenacity, Spell Crit

Create help function for all custom + default attributes, for simplicity the mod should handle all the getting/setting in a consistant way
